			<p>
				Mork is a more or less sick
				<strong>database format for text files</strong>
				. Some of the ideas behind it are good, some are ...
				bad. Nevertheless, Mork is used in some widespread
				applications and up to today, there is no independent
				library available which can handle Mork files.
			</p>
			<p>
				This project's goal is to provide a Java implementation
				for the Mork format.
				<strong>
					The primary goal of jMork is to provide read
					functionality to database files.
				</strong>
				The focus is not on writing Mork files. The Mozilla
				applications which use Mork files (Firefox, Thunderbird)
				will replace the format in the future nevertheless.
			</p>
			<p>
				Mork consists of dictionaries (key/value maps), database
				items like table, row, cell and a transactional-style
				semantic called groups. The data can be stored as
				literal values or as referenced identifiers, which point
				to values in the dictionaries. The data itself is
				contained in tables or loose rows. Cells are simple
				assignments (key=value).
			</p>
			<p>
				Some effort has been put into how values are escaped,
				how compression could be made more effective. But these
				efforts are not worth the trouble which you have parsing
				the format.
